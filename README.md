<h1>3112 Project: A* Search with a GUI</h1>
<hr>


<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p><em>This project is for my ITCS 3112 class (Design and Implementation of Object Oriented Systems). We had free reign over what sort of work we wanted to do, with the minimum requirements being that we incorporate things we had learned throughout the semester, and build some sort of graphical user interface. We chose to do an A* search as one of our team members had familiarity with the algorithm from a previous class, and a graphical depiction would further build our understanding of the algorithm and it's uses.</em></p>
